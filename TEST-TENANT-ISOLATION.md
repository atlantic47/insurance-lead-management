# Tenant Isolation Diagnostic Report

## Current Status

### Database Analysis
- **Total Tenants:** 5
- **Tenants with Data:**
  - `default-tenant-000` (Default Agency): 144 leads, 56 conversations, 82 messages
  - `2e7a0564-733d-4970-93e6-b72794006750` (Buck and Whitley Plc): 1 lead, 1 conversation, 1 message (test data)
  - `64831fe2-3cf1-425d-885e-5ba33d90f46c` (Monroe Trevino Associates): 1 lead, 1 conversation, 1 message (test data)
  - Other tenants: NO DATA

### Security Fixes Applied ✅
1. ✅ Database schema updated with `tenantId` on `ChatMessage` and `EmailMessage`
2. ✅ Migration applied successfully
3. ✅ All queries now filter by tenant
4. ✅ All message creates include tenantId
5. ✅ Webhook middleware validates tenant
6. ✅ Endpoints protected

### Current Issue
**API returns 0 conversations for all users, even when database shows conversations exist.**

This suggests:
1. Either the Prisma query is failing silently
2. Or there's a relation/include filtering issue with the new `tenantId` on ChatMessage

## Action Required

**Please answer these questions:**

1. **Which specific email/user are you logged in as when you see "other people's WhatsApp messages"?**
   - [ ] admin@insurance.com (Default Agency)
   - [ ] manager@insurance.com (Default Agency)
   - [ ] agent1@insurance.com (Default Agency)
   - [ ] Other: _______________

2. **How are you accessing the messages?**
   - [ ] Through the React/Next.js frontend at http://localhost:3000
   - [ ] Through API calls (Postman/curl) at http://localhost:3001
   - [ ] Other: _______________

3. **When you say "other people's messages," do you mean:**
   - [ ] Messages from users within the SAME company/tenant (this is NORMAL - users in the same company should see each other's messages)
   - [ ] Messages from users in DIFFERENT companies/tenants (this is the BUG we need to fix)

4. **Can you check if there's a specific page/route where you're seeing these messages?**
   - URL: _______________
   - Page name: _______________

## Quick Test You Can Run

### Test 1: Check if users from SAME tenant can see each other's messages (EXPECTED)

Login as `admin@insurance.com` (password: `admin123`) and check messages.
Login as `manager@insurance.com` and check messages.

**Expected:** Both see the SAME messages (they're in the same company)

### Test 2: Check if users from DIFFERENT tenants see cross-contamination (BUG)

We need to know the password for users in other tenants to test this properly.

Current test users:
- `sidigy@mailinator.com` - Buck and Whitley Plc (password unknown)
- `norilar@mailinator.com` - Monroe Trevino Associates (password unknown)

**Can you provide passwords for these users, or create new test users with known passwords?**

## Next Steps

Once you provide the above information, I can:
1. Identify the exact source of the cross-tenant visibility
2. Apply the targeted fix
3. Verify isolation is working correctly
